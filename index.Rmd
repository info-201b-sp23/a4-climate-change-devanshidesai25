## The Data Set

From the data set, I mainly focused on three countries that I know produce the most amount of carbon emissions in the world, which are China, India, and the United States. I thought it would be interesting to understand how these countries have produced co2 emissions over time and what are causes of their carbon emissions, for example consumption-based emissions, oil-based emissions, or production-based emissions, since these are also some of the major causes for increased carbon emissions world-wide.

This data set was collected by the organization [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions) which uses research and data to make progress against the world's largest problems including climate change, disease, poverty, etc., and aims to make data accessible to the public so that more people can know about these issues, which can lead to change. The data in the dataset has been collected by thousands of researchers and scientists over time from 1800 to 2021. Some limitations of this data set are that some countries have missing values for certain variables, especially less established countries, which makes it difficult to understand how smaller countries are affected by climate change.

## Summary of Variables

I found first that the country that creates the **most consumption based carbon emissions** out of these three is the **United States**, with **180,878.53**  consumption-based emissions of carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚), measured in million tonnes from 1800 to 2021.

I then found that the **year with the highest percent growth in carbon emissions** was **1832** with a **33.495%** growth in emissions from the year before. 

Next I found that **China** has produced **34491.543 oil-based emissions** of carbon dioxide, measured in million tonnes from 1800 to 2021.

I also found that **India** has produced **37018.082 coal-based emissions** of carbon dioxide measured in million tonnes from 1800 to 2021.

Finally I found that the **USA** has produced **161275.016 gas-based emissions** of carbon dioxide measured in million tonnes from 1800 to 2021.

## Insights from Visualization

From my visualization, I saw that the United States has significantly higher oil-based carbon emissions than any other individual country in the data-set. The USAs carbon emissions increased significantly after the year 1900. The next highest individual country in recent years, would be China, but even China produces significantly lower emissions than the USA. I also noticed that almost every country in the data set had an overall upwards trend in oil-based carbon emissions from 1800 to 2021, meaning that global emission rates have overall increased significantly in this period of time.
